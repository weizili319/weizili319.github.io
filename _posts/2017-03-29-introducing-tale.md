Some parts are preconfigured and shouldn’t be touched as the comments project.

Tale is minimal [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme curated for storytellers. It is designed and developed by [myself](https://github.com/chesterhow/) for a friend who writes short stories.

### Mandatory Settings
- Compatible with GitHub Pages
- Responsive design (looks just as good on mobile)
- Syntax highlighting, with the help of Pygments
- Markdown and HTML text formatting
- Pagination of posts

Head over to the [Example Content]({{ site.baseurl }}/2017-03-16/example-content) post for a showcase of Tale's text formatting features.

### Browser Support
Tale works on most if not all modern browsers, including Chrome, Safari and Firefox 👍🏼
